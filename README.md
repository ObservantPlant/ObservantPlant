### About me ðŸ‘‹


**ObservantPlant/ObservantPlant** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on skills to take future me places.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about how to plan and organize technical information.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm apparently pretty good at taking care of plants - they never seem to die, which is a good thing I guess. But since I don't have unlimited space, I also almost never get to enjoy new plants...
